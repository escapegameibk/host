This directory contains the ECPROTO implementation for the escape game system's
host.

The directory consists of the following files:

 - ecp_game.c:
	This file contains game related content, such as the init, reset and 
	start functions. Triggers and dependencies have been offloaded
	into separate files though...
 - ecp_init:
	This file contains bus initialisation routines which are used to
	initialy sync the devices on the bus or recover devices after errors.
 - ecp_io.c:
	This file contains device interaction stuff, used to receive frames from
	the underlying layer, most of the time it should be hardware.
 - ecp_msg_handleing.c
	This file contains the parseing logic for frames, calling responsible
	functions and altering objects.
 - ecp_tools.c:
	This file contains tool functions. These functions should AT NO COST
	alter any kind of global object, nor should they have any kind of effect
	or so. They are usually just some tools to convert something, set a few
	flags in an object passed onto them, or such...
