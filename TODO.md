# About

This file contains ideas and other stuff which may be added to the escape game
system in the future. Difficult ideas may be noted here. 

## Error Handling for conection loose

It would be useful to handle anyone pulling at any usb device. Just for fucks's
sake.

## Camera view via website

Viewing cameras via the website would be rather nice too eh?

## User error notification

implementing an error queue into the host would be helpful. Especially to notify
the user of WHAT kind of error happened.
